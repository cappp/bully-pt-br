1032446931=You won't be able to get through this way.
1032446932=We've got all of Blue Skies Industrial Park blocked off. You'll need to go through the Red Star Industries lot.
1032446933=It looks like the power outage reset these gates. We'll have to go the back way around.
1032446934=There's a back alley from the trainyard. Let's go!
1032446935=There's no way through this barricade. You'll have to find another way around.
1032446936=This power outage must have reset these security gates. You'll have to find another way around.
1032446937=Now that we've got the power restored, we've gotta get to the chem plant.
1032446938=And to do that, you're gonna have to take on Omar.
1032446939=Who's Omar?
1032447061=Omar is Edgar's second. He's the only one with the key to the chem plant gate.

1032447063=He usually hangs out around the Gloop Oil container.
1032447064=Alright, let's go.
1032447065=This gate is locked. Without power, there's no way to open it again.

1032447067=This gate is controlled by an electronic switch inside the security office.
1032447068=Be careful. Edgar has a couple of the guys in there keeping track of who goes in and out.
1032447069=Edgar's a bit paranoid, isn't he?
1032447070=There's a reason he was put in the asylum, Jimmy.
1032447192=You know he's insane, but you hang out with him anyway?
1032447193=Jimmy, you just drove a car built by nerds into our barricade.
1032447194=Now you plan to fight your way through our complex to confront Edgar, the toughest bastard I've ever met.
1032447195=I wouldn't exactly say that YOUR grip on reality is all that firm.
1032447196=What's that supposed to mean?
1032447197=Don't worry, I like 'em a bit crazy. Just don't start frothing at the mouth.
1032447198=I just washed this shirt.
1032447199=Get to the chem plant entrance.
1032447200=Hold ~MANUAL_LOCK~ and press ~CROUCH~ to crawl.
